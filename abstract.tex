A $J^ 2$-gem is a 4-regular, 4-edge-colored planar graph $G$ obtained from the
intersection pattern of two polygonal Jordan curves $X$ and $Y$ with $2n$-crossings.
These crossings define consecutive segments of $X$ inside $Y$ which we color 2,
define consecutive segments of $X$ outside $Y$ which we color 3; likewise,
they define consectutive segments of $Y$ inside $X$ which we color $0$ and define
consecutive segments of $Y$ outside $Y$, which we color $1$. These colored 
consecutive segments are the edges of $G$, the crossings being its vertices.
Let $G^ \star$ be the 3-dimensional abstract 3-complex formed by taking a set of 
vertex colored tetrahedra in 1--1 correspondence with $V(G)$ so that each tetrahedra
has vertices of colors 0,1,2,3. For each $i$-colored edge of $G$ with ends $u$ and $v$
paste the corresponding tetrahedra $\nabla_u$ and $\nabla_v$ so that the two triangular
faces coincide and having a color matching of the pairs of other 3 colors. We show that the topological space 
$|G^\star|$ induced by $G^\star$ is $\mathbb{S}^ 3$. Moreover we describe an $O(n^2)$-algorithm
to make available a PL-embedding of $G^\star$ with spherical geometry, having
explicit coordinates in $\mathbb{S}^ 3$.
This is rather surprising because such PL-embeddings are often of exponential size.
This work is the first step towards obtaining, via an $O(N^ 2)$-algorithm,
a framed link presentation inducing the same closed orientable 3-manifold
as the one given by a triangulation. 
Previous work on this topic appear in
\cite{linsmachadoA2012}, \cite{linsmachadoB2012} and \cite{linsmachadoC2012}.
However, this paper is entirely self-contained.

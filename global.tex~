Let be given a {\em colored 3-pseudo-triangulation} $K$ with $n$ tetrahedra.
Colored means that each tetrahedron have vertices 
distinctively colored 0,1,2,3.
In a {\em pseudo} 3-triangulation the intersection of simplices might be subsets of simplices
of smaller dimensions, instead of singletons of such faces, 
as for true triangulations. If $K$ is the dual of a $J^2$-gem (shortly defined),
then we show that $|K|$ is $\mathbb{S}^3$ and we make available an $O(n^2$)-algorithm to produce a
PL-embedding (\cite{rourke1982introduction}) of $K$ into $\mathbb{S}^3$.
This is rather surprising because such PL-embeddings are often of exponential size.
This work is the first step towards obtaining, via an $O(n^ 2)$-algorithm,
a framed link presentation inducing the same closed orientable 3-manifold
as the one given by a colored pseudo-triangulation.

\section{Introduction}
A {\em $J^ 2$-gem} is a 4-regular, 4-edge-colored planar graph $G$ obtained from the
intersection pattern of two Jordan curves $X$ and $Y$ with $2n$ transversal
crossings.
These crossings define consecutive segments of $X$ alternatively 
inside $Y$ and outside $Y$. Color the first type 2 and the second type 3.
The crossings also define consecutive segments of $Y$ alternatively 
inside $X$ and outside $X$. Color the first type 0 and the second type 1.
This defines a 4-regular 4-edge-colored graph $G$ where the vertices are the crossings
and the edges are the colored colored segments.
Let $K$ be the 3-dimensional abstract 3-complex formed by taking a set of 
vertex colored tetrahedra in 1--1 correspondence with $V(G)$ so that each tetrahedra
has vertices of colors 0,1,2,3. For each $i$-colored edge of $G$ with ends $u$ and $v$
paste the corresponding tetrahedra $\nabla_u$ and $\nabla_v$ so as to paste the two triangular
faces that do not contain a vertex of color $i$ in such a way as to
to match vertices of the other three colors. 
We show that the topological space 
$|K|$ induced by $K$ is $\mathbb{S}^ 3$. Moreover we describe an $O(n^2)$-algorithm
to make available a PL-embedding (\cite{rourke1982introduction}) of $G^\star$ 
into $\mathbb{S}^3$. We get explicit coordinates in $\mathbb{S}^ 3$ for the 0-simplices and
the p-simplices $(p \in \{1,2,3\}$) are linear simplices in the spherical geometry.


\section{Gems and their duals}
A {\em (3+1)-graph} \index{(3+1)-graph} $G$ is a connected regular graph of degree 4 where 
to each vertex there are four incident differently colored edges in the color 
set $\{0,1,2,3\}$.
\index{residue}
For $I \subseteq \{0,1,2,3\}$, an {\em $I$-residue} is a component of the subgraph 
induced by the $I$-colored edges. Denote by $v(G)$ the number of
$0$-residues (vertices) of $G$. For $0\le i < j\le3$, an $\{i,j\}$-residue is also 
called an {\em $ij$-gon} or an $i$- and $j$-colored {\em bigon} (it is an even polygon, where the edges are 
alternatively colored $i$ and $j$). Denote by $b(G)$ the total number of $ij$-gons 
for $0\le i < j\le3$. Denote by $t(G)$ the total number of 
$\overline{i}$-residues for $0\le i\le 3$, where $\overline{i}$ 
means complement of $\{i\}$ in $\{0,1,2,3\}$.

We briefly recall the definition of gems taken from \cite{lins1995gca}.
A {\em $3$-gem} \index{3-gem} is a $(3+1)$-graph $G$
satisfying $v(G)+t(G)=b(G)$. This relation is equivalent to having the vertices, 
edges and bigons 
restricted to any $\{i,j,k\}$-residue inducing a plane graph where the 
faces are bounded by the 
bigons. Therefore we can embed each such $\{i,j,k\}$-residue into a sphere 
$\mathbb{S}^2$. We consider
the ball bounded this $\mathbb{S}^2$ as induced by the  $\{i,j,k\}$-residue. For this reason
an $\{i,j,k\}$-residue in a 3-gem, $i<j<k$, is also called a \index{triball} {\em triball}.
An $ij$-gon appears once in the boundary of triball $\{i,j,k\}$ and once in the boundary
of triball $\{i,j,h\}$. By pasting the triballs along disks bounded by all 
the pairs of $ij$-gons, $\{i,j\} \subset \{0,1,2,3\}$ of a gem $G$,
we obtain a closed 3-manifold denoted by $|G|$. 
This general construction is dual to the one 
exemplified in the abstract and produces any closed 3-manifold. 
The manifold is orientable if and only if 
$G$ is bipartite, \cite{lins1985graph}. 

Let $K$ be the dual of a gem $G$.
An $\overline{i}$-residue of $G$ corresponds in $K$ to a $0$-simplex of $K$. Most 0-simplices of $K$
do not correspond to $\overline{i}$-residues of $G$.
An $ij$-gon of a gem $G$ corresponds in $K$ to a {\em PL1-face} formed by a sequence of
1-simplices of $K$; this PL1-face is the intersection of two PL2-faces of colors $i$ and $j$; their
two bounding $0$-simplices correspond to an $\overline{h}$- and to a $\overline{k}$-residue, where
$\{h,i,j,k\}=\{0,1,2,3\}$.
An $i$-colored edge of $G$ corresponds to a {\em PL2-face} 
which is a 2-disk triangulated by a subset of $i$-colored 2-simplices of $K$. Finally to a vertex of $G$, 
it corresponds a {\em PL3-face} of $K$ which is a 3-ball formed by a subset of 3-simplices of $K$.


In this work we describe the embedded $PL3$-faces of $K$ by making it geometrically clear that its boundary
is a set of 4 PL2-faces, one of each color forming an embedded $\mathbb{S}^2$ whose interior is
disjoint from the interior of $\mathbb{S}^2$'s corresponding to others $PL3$-faces. Thus, for our purposes
it will be only necessary to embed the 2-skeleton of $K$.
Our strategy to embed $K$ into $\mathbb{S}^3$ is removing one of its $PL3$-faces and obtain an embedding of
the remaining ball into $\mathbb{R}^3$ after coming back to $\mathbb{S}^3$ by an inverse stereographic projection
with its center in the exterior of the triangulated ball.

The 0-simplex $a_1$ is $\frac  {z_0+z_2}{2}$. The 0-simplex $b_1$ is $\frac  {z_2+z_1}{2}$. Note that, in general, the PL3-faces are given by their boundary.

The set of stars is called a { \em  rotation}  and has the characterizing property that each edge appears twice. The general case of changing rotation when going from $\mathcal  {W}_{m-1} \cup \mathcal  {N}_{m-1}$ to $\mathcal  {W}_{m} \cup \mathcal  {N}_{m}$ is depicted above: labels $X,Y,Z$ stand for arbitrary (maybe empty) sequences of edges; the vertex $XxyzYt$ breaks into three $Xxnt'$, $nyn't$ and $n'zYt''$ and the vertex $Zt$ changes into $Zt'tt''$.
